Community detection, a powerful tool in network analysis, involves parƟƟoning a network into
groups of nodes that share common characterisƟcs or exhibit strong connections among themselves.
In the context of financial markets, this translates into idenƟfying subsets of stocks that move in
tandem, potenƟally revealing underlying paƩerns or market sectors.
This project explores the dynamic landscape of financial markets by leveraging community detection
algorithms on stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The primary objective is to unveil subsets of
stocks sharing similar behaviour’s, revealing underlying patterns and market dynamics. The
proposed approach focuses on the evaluation of key metrics, including Separability, clustering
coefficient, Fraction over median degree, conductance, Normalized cut, and Cut Ratio, to assess the
effectiveness of the community detection algorithm.
Utilizing network analysis techniques, the project partitions the stock market into cohesive
communities, identifying stocks that move in tandem. The Separability metric ensures clear
demarcations between these communities, emphasizing the distinctiveness of the identified subsets.
Clustering coefficient and Fraction over median degree offer insights into the internal cohesion and
degree distribution within communities, enhancing the understanding of network structures.
Conductance and Normalized cut evaluate the quality of partitions, considering the balance between
internal and external connections. The Cut Ratio metric further contributes to the assessment,
offering a comprehensive evaluation of community balance and cohesion. The project utilizes
financial data sourced from Yahoo Finance, including historical stock prices and trading volumes, to
construct a meaningful network for analysis.
